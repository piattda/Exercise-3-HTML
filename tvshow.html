      a Netflix Mexico series.
    </p>
    <p>
      La Casa de Las Flores follows the De La Mora family,
      a dysfunctional upper-class Mexican family that owns
      a flower shop and a club both called The House of Flowers.
      This show doesn't shy away from controversial themes.
      It consists of several LGBT+ characters and routinley
      tackles problems such as homophobia and transphobia.
      The show is also a satirization of the telenovela genre.
      Each season focuses on a different aspect of the De La Mora family.
      The episodes are short and fast paced, always engaging
      and will leave you dying of laughter. It's even better if you
      can understand the original Spanish the show was filmed in.
      Go to Netflix and enjoy the wonderful rollercoaster that
      is La Casa de Las Flores.
